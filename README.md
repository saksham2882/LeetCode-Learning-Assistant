## Project Overview

The **LeetCode Learning Assistant** is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your LeetCode problem-solving experience. It integrates directly into LeetCode problem pages, providing a sleek, sliding panel with **AI-powered** guidance using the **Gemini 2.5 Flash** API. <br>
From high-level hints to complete Java solutions and complexity analysis, this tool supports coders at all levels with a structured, step-by-step learning path. Its modern UI, robust error handling, and secure API key management make it a must-have for mastering coding challenges.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration :** Adds an "Analyze Problem" button on LeetCode problem pages.

- **Structured Guidance :**
    - **Hints :** 3-4 concise, numbered hints to spark logical thinking without revealing solutions.
    - **Algorithmic Approach :** Outlines the optimal data structure and algorithm with numbered steps.
    -  **Pseudocode :** Language-agnostic pseudocode in numbered steps for clarity.
    -  **Solution :** Complete, well-commented Java code with a flow explanation.
    -  **Complexity Analysis :** Time and space complexity with concise reasoning.
      
- **Modern UI :** Responsive sliding panel with custom scrollbar and syntax-highlighted code.

- **Secure API Key Storage :** Save your Gemini API key via the extension popup.
  
- **Robust Error Handling :** Clear error messages and retry logic for API failures.
  
- **Formatted Responses :** Markdown-formatted output with proper code blocks for readability.

## Browser Support

The extension is fully tested and supported on:
- **Google Chrome**
- **Microsoft Edge**

It also work on other Chromium-based browsers (e.g., **Brave**, **Opera**), but official support to Chrome and Edge.

---
## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:

## How It Works

- ### API Key Setup
1. Click the **extension icon** in the browser toolbar to open the **API Key** popup.
2. Enter your **Gemini API key** in the input field.
3. Click **"Save Key"** to store the key securely.
4. Verify the confirmation message (green for success, red for errors).

- ### Using in LeetCode
1. Navigate to a LeetCode problem page (e.g., `https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/`).
2. Click the **"Analyze Problem"** button to open the sliding assistant panel.
3. Use the **"Reveal"** buttons to access:
   - **Hints :** 3-4 short hints to guide your thinking.
   - **Approach :** Data structure and algorithm details.
   - **Pseudocode :** Step-by-step pseudocode for the optimal solution.
   - **Solution :** Java code with comments and explanation.
   - **Complexity :** Time and space complexity analysis.
4. Click the close button (Ã—) to hide the panel.
